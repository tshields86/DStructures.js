# Sorting Algorithms

This directory contains implementations of various sorting algorithms. Below is a brief description of each:

## Bubble Sort (`bubbleSort.js`)
Bubble Sort is a simple sorting algorithm that repeatedly steps through the list, compares adjacent elements, and swaps them if they are in the wrong order. This process is repeated until the list is sorted.

## Insertion Sort (`insertionSort.js`)
Insertion Sort works by building a sorted array one element at a time. It takes elements from the input data and inserts them in the correct position in the already sorted list.

## Merge Sort (`mergeSort.js`)
Merge Sort is a divide-and-conquer algorithm that divides the unsorted list into \(n\) sublists, each containing one element, and then repeatedly merges sublists to produce new sorted sublists until there is only one sublist remaining.

## Quick Sort (`quickSort.js`)
Quick Sort is a divide-and-conquer algorithm that works by selecting a 'pivot' element from the array and partitioning the other elements into two sub-arrays according to whether they are less than or greater than the pivot. The sub-arrays are then sorted recursively.

## Selection Sort (`selectionSort.js`)
Selection Sort works by repeatedly finding the minimum element from the unsorted part of the array and putting it at the beginning. It's an in-place comparison-based sorting algorithm.
