This directory contains implementations of various graph algorithms. Below is a brief description:

## Dijkstra's Algorithm (`dijkstra/dijkstra.js`)

Dijkstra's algorithm is a graph search algorithm that solves the single-source shortest path problem for a graph with non-negative edge weights, producing a shortest path tree. This algorithm is often used in routing and as a subroutine in other graph algorithms.

Given a graph and a source vertex, Dijkstra's algorithm finds the shortest path from the source to all vertices in the given graph.
